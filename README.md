Random plugins for [Bohemian Coding Sketch App](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)

##AEFlowchart
The idea of this plugin is to make it fast and easy to draw flowcharts in Sketch, because why not?

Basically, you add some text labels, convert them to appropriate flowchart shapes and then connect them.
