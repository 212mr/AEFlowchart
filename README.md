#sketch-plugins
Random plugins for [Bohemian Coding Sketch App](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)

##AEFlowchart
The idea of this plugin is to make it fast and easy to draw flowcharts in Sketch, because why not?

> It's still work in a progress (works as it should for process and start-end steps), 
because I'm currently stuck with drawing custom shapes (beside rectangle).
> For now, I still didn't find anything about that in developers API, documentation, and heck, even on the GitHub.
